## **Overview**

In Vietnam, a **sales invoice** is a formal accounting document issued by a seller to record the sale of goods or services. It is governed by strict legal and tax regulations and typically comes in the form of an **electronic invoice (hÃ³a Ä‘Æ¡n Ä‘iá»‡n tá»­)**.

Sales invoices are essential for:

- Tax declaration and deduction
- Legal proof of transaction
- Financial reporting and auditing

ðŸ“Œ Legal Basis

- **Decree 123/2020/ND-CP**: Governs the use of invoices and documents.
- **Circular 78/2021/TT-BTC**: Details the implementation of electronic invoices.
- **General Department of Taxation (GDT)**: Oversees compliance and issuance.

ðŸ§¾ Whatâ€™s Included in a Sales Invoice

- Seller and buyer information
- Invoice code and number
- Date of issuance
- Description of goods/services
- Quantity and unit price
- Total amount and VAT (if applicable)
- Digital signature (for electronic invoices)

- "eInvoice": Clearly signals the domainâ€”electronic invoices
- "Lens": Implies precision, scanning, and insight (like a camera or microscope)
- Feels like a modular engine or AI-powered tool
- Easy to remember, pronounce, and scale into a product or API

## **Implementation Logic**

Transform data into a clean format:
(a) Remove rows with all empty values
(b) Remove duplicate rows
(c) Group items by the following criteria:
(i) The first column is either "Tong tien thanh toan" or empty
(ii) The second column is either "So tien bang chu" or empty
(d) Map values to their corresponding namespace using a Language Model (LLM)
(e) Convert data types to numbers and strings
(f) Verify that the total number of rows is correct
